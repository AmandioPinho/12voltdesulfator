12 Volt DC Battery Desulfator Circuit (Gerber Files)

Thank you for checking out my repository for my version of a desulfator circuit.  It is a corrected version of "Frontier Springs" desulfator circuit.  In their version the mosfet was flipped making the circuit inoperative and I also added an led to show that the circuit was working.  

Feel free to download the latest version of the gerber files and make one for yourself.  I suggest using OSHPark.com to order your circuit boards.  These zip files are perfectly set up for OSHPark and they are the same one's I use.  

README.md - this file your reading  
parts_list.txt - parts list and part numbers.  
schematic vX.XX.jpg - Schematic picture  
desulfator vX.XX.zip - Gerber files suitable for uploading to OSHPark  
desulfator vX.XX kicad source.zip - source files and libraries for kicad EDA  
desulfator.pdf - Original desulfator article from "Home Power Magazine" issue #88  
pcb v0.90.jpg - Photo of unpopulated and populated PCB  

Lastly this is an open source hardware circuit.  I created the version you see here.  It if free for you to use.  If you feel inclined to give thanks to me, please throw me a few $$ with the button below.  All $ is used for my own prototyping of these circuits and every bit helps and is always appreciated!
